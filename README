Botany - a natural plant regrowth plugin for bukkit
======

The aim of this plugin is to provide a consistent and persistent
vegetation to bukkit worlds. Consistent means that for each biome
the player can expect the vegetation to be of certain types and
densities. Persistent means that if plants are removed from an area
that they grow back over time, creating the appearance of an active
vegetation.

The plugin picks a random spot and determines whether that spot
is a candidate for planting by checking plant densities around that
location.  If there are plants appropriate for the biome on that spot,
and the current density is lower than a threshold value for a plant,
that plant type is planted at the location.

We collect and analyze plant data from generated default worlds, and
determine base plant levels for each biome. This data is converted into
a plant-density-biome matrix that is implemented in the code itself.

Data sample sets are collected in the data/ folder in the source code,
and contain biome,plant_type,density_average values line-by-line

Usage information is posted on the dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/botany
